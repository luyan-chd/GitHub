In the Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) mid-rise residential, the multi-limbs built-up open section (MBOS) columns composed of three or four component lipped channel sections are frequently used at the junctions of the walls to bear larger loads, as shown in Figure 1. In comparison to the built-up sections with simple cross-sectional forms, such as back-to-back and face-to-face sections composed of two component lipped channel sections, the MBOS bring higher flexural and torsional rigidity, resulting in higher loading capacity. However, the increased number of components has also introduced new challenges.This study presents a unified model for predicting the load-bearing capacity of multi-limb cold-formed thin-walled steel sections using machine learning. The dataset and code related to the research are provided in the attachment. For more details, please refer to the paper titled "Unified machine-learning-based design method for cold-formed steel multi-limbs built-up open section columns," published by the research team in the Structures journal.
